### **Task 1 – Global CO₂ Emissions Data Analysis**

#### ** Objective**

For this task, I analyzed the rise and pattern of **global CO₂ emissions** over the years.
The goal was to clean, explore, and visualize the dataset to understand how emissions vary globally and per capita across regions.

#### ** About the Dataset**

The dataset contains global and country-wise CO₂ emission data, sourced from the **Global Carbon Budget (GCB 2022)** dataset available on **Kaggle**.
It includes total emissions, per capita values, and sources of CO₂ such as fossil fuels, industry, and land use.

**Data Files Used:**

* `GCB2022v27_MtCO2_flat.csv`
* `GCB2022v27_percapita_flat.csv`
* `GCB2022v27_sources_flat.csv`

#### **⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization and trend analysis
* **NumPy** – for numerical calculations

#### ** Steps Performed**

1. Loaded and merged multiple CSV files for a complete overview.
2. Cleaned missing values and standardized country names.
3. Explored relationships between total and per capita CO₂ emissions.
4. Created visualizations showing emission trends over time.

#### ** Key Insights**

* Global CO₂ emissions have steadily increased since the 1900s, with a slight dip during global crises like 2020.
* Per capita emissions vary significantly across regions, with developing nations catching up in recent decades.
* Energy sources remain the biggest contributor to overall emissions.

#### **📚 Learnings**

Through this project, I learned how to handle multi-file datasets, merge data efficiently, and build meaningful visualizations that show global environmental trends.
